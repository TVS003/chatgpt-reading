            <h2>Responsible Use and Academic Integrity</h2>
            <p>Maintaining academic integrity while incorporating AI tools into assessment requires careful planning and clear communication with students. Teachers must establish transparent guidelines about how AI can be used appropriately in learning and assessment contexts, ensuring that technology enhances rather than replaces critical thinking and authentic student work.</p>
            
            <ul class="integrity-list">
                <li><strong>Always review AI-generated content before use:</strong> Ensure questions are accurate, age-appropriate, and aligned with learning objectives. Verify that content matches your curriculum standards and student needs.</li>
                <li><strong>Encourage students to show their reasoning:</strong> Require students to explain their thought processes and justify their answers, even when using AI as a learning tool. This promotes metacognition and authentic understanding.</li>
                <li><strong>Use AI as a supplement, not a substitute, for teacher judgment:</strong> Maintain human oversight in all assessment decisions. AI should enhance your professional expertise, not replace your pedagogical knowledge and student relationships.</li>
