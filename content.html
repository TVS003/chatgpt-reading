            <p>ChatGPT can transform reading instruction by encouraging active reading through interactive questioning, helping teachers generate targeted comprehension questions that meet diverse student needs, and supporting differentiated learning by providing personalized explanations and examples. When used thoughtfully, this AI tool becomes a powerful ally in creating engaging, student-centered reading experiences that build both comprehension skills and critical thinking abilities.</p>

            <h2>Practical Classroom Applications</h2>
            
            <div class="strategy">
                <h3>Generating Questions for Discussion</h3>
                <p>Teachers can use ChatGPT to create leveled comprehension questions that target specific reading skills like inference, main idea, or character analysis. Simply paste a passage and ask ChatGPT to generate questions at different difficulty levels, from literal recall to higher-order thinking. This saves planning time while ensuring questions align with learning objectives. Always review and adapt the generated questions to match your specific curriculum and student needs.</p>
                <blockquote class="teacher-tip">Tip: Always ask students to compare ChatGPT's answers with their own reasoning to build critical thinking.</blockquote>
            </div>

            <div class="strategy">
                <h3>Summarizing Passages Together</h3>
                <p>Use ChatGPT as a collaborative tool where students first create their own summaries, then compare them with AI-generated summaries to identify key elements they might have missed. This process helps students understand what makes an effective summary while developing their own summarization skills. The AI can also help break down complex passages into simpler language for struggling readers, making challenging texts more accessible.</p>
                <blockquote class="teacher-tip">Tip: Have students explain why they agree or disagree with ChatGPT's summary choices to deepen comprehension.</blockquote>
            </div>

            <div class="strategy">
                <h3>Building Vocabulary through Context</h3>
                <p>ChatGPT excels at providing context clues and multiple examples of how unfamiliar words are used in different situations. Teachers can input challenging vocabulary from reading passages and ask ChatGPT to create example sentences, synonyms, and explanations that help students understand word meanings. This approach supports vocabulary development while maintaining the connection to authentic reading materials and real-world usage.</p>
                <blockquote class="teacher-tip">Tip: Ask ChatGPT to create vocabulary activities like fill-in-the-blank exercises using the target words.</blockquote>
            </div>

            <div class="strategy">
                <h3>Supporting Struggling Readers</h3>
                <p>ChatGPT can provide personalized support by breaking down complex sentences, explaining difficult concepts in simpler terms, or creating alternative explanations when students don't understand initial instruction. Teachers can use it to generate reading guides, create visual organizers, or develop step-by-step reading strategies tailored to individual student needs. This targeted support helps build confidence while maintaining appropriate challenge levels.</p>
                <blockquote class="teacher-tip">Tip: Use ChatGPT to create reading checklists and self-monitoring tools for independent reading practice.</blockquote>

            <h2>Responsible and Ethical Use</h2>
            <ul class="ethics-list">
                <li><strong>Checking for factual accuracy:</strong> Always verify AI-generated information against reliable sources, especially for historical, scientific, or current events content. Teach students to fact-check and cross-reference information.</li>
                <li><strong>Maintaining student privacy:</strong> Never input student names, personal information, or specific student work into ChatGPT. Use generic examples and protect student confidentiality at all times.</li>
                <li><strong>Promoting independent thinking:</strong> Use ChatGPT as a tool to enhance, not replace, student thinking. Encourage students to develop their own ideas first, then use AI to expand or refine their understanding.</li>
